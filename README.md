# Udacity_DS_project_1
First project in my udacity-misk Data Science nano-degree: Blog post

Key Steps for Project
Following the CRISP-DM process in finding solutions

1) I have used the traffic accidents data in KSA for the year 1439 Hijri calendar.

2) My business questions are:
    - What is the total number of accidents per month?
    - What is the percentage of children that are involved in these accidents per month?
    - What is the the percentage of children involved for each region during the whole year?
    - Comparing the largest regions in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where is the highest percentage of children involvement into traffic accidents?

3) I have created a Jupyter Notebook to explore and analyse the data:

    Preparing the data:

      - Read all sheets in the excel workbook and combine them.  
      - Clean data, rename columns, and change the arabic naming of months to english words.<br>  
      - Create a dataframe for the data containing the age categories.<br>  
      - Provide visualized answers for my business questions

4) Please go to my blog post, where I present my insights:<br>
